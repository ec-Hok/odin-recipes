        <h3><strong>Steps to Make Hanger Steak</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p><strong>Step 1</strong></p></li>
            <p>Remove all silver skin and extra fat from steak.
                Carefully cut out the connctive tissue that cnnects the 2 halves of the steak,
                 separating the whole into 2 long prices.
                  Cut lobe of the meat from one half (it's a price that is slightly separated from the larger half).
                   Then cut each of the 2 larger halves into 2 steaks each.
                    Sprinkler with salt and pepper.</p>
            <li><p><strong>Step 2</strong></p></li>
            <p> Heat skillet over high heat.
                 Add clarified butter when pan is hot, then place the steaks in the pan.
                  Reduce heat to medium.
                   Cook until browned on all sides, firm, and reddish-pink on the inside.
                    An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 125 degrees F, a total of about 12 minutes.
                     Transfer to a warm plate and tent with foil to let the steaks rest and allow temperature to riseto 130 degrees F. </p>
            <li><p><strong>Step 3</strong></p></li>
            <p>Pour broth into skillet set over medium heat.
                Stir with a wooden spoon scraping up the browned bits from the bottom.
                 When brownings dissolve and liquid begins to reduce after 2 or 3 minutes, reduce the heat to low.
                  Add accumulated juices from the meat, balsamic vinegar, and butter chunks.
                   Cook and stir until butter melts.
                    If liquid has reduced too much, add a splash of broth.
                     Taste to check if needs a bit of salt.</p>
        </ol>
